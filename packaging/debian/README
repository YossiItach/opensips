Debian Packaging of OpenSER
===========================

Overview
--------

The packaging system for OpenSER uses templates to generate the files required
by Debian packaging system. The templates give the possibility to generate
different types of OpenSER packages, at this moment can be built packages
with or without TLS support.

Builiding OpenSER Debian packages including TLS support
-------------------------------------------------------

This is default option for Debian packages. The simplest way is to go in
'sip-server' (the source directory) folder and do 'make deb'.

If you are not happy with the commnads issued by 'make deb' then go in
'sip-server' folder and run following commands:

  # ln -s packaging/debian
  # cd debian
  # make
  # cd ..

Now the files needed by Debian packaging system are generated. You can start
building the Debian packages in your way. At the end you can clean the 'debian'
folder with:

  # cd debian
  # make clean
  # cd ..
  # rm debian

Builiding OpenSER Debian packages without TLS support
-----------------------------------------------------

The simplest way is to go in 'sip-server' folder and do 'make deb-notls'.

If you want to do a custom building process, then go in in 'sip-server' folder
and run following commands:

  # ln -s packaging/debian
  # cd debian
  # make notls
  # cd ..

Now the files needed by Debian packaging system are generated. You can start
building the Debian packages in your way. At the end you can clean the 'debian'
folder with:

  # cd debian
  # make clean
  # cd ..
  # rm debian

Passing parameters to Debian packaging application
--------------------------------------------------

'make deb' and 'make deb-notls' use 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -tc' command
to build Debian packages. You can pass additional parameters to
'dpkg-buildpackage' via 'DEBBUILD_EXTRA_OPTIONS' environment variable.

For example: 'DEBBUILD_EXTRA_OPTIONS="-us -uc" make deb' will build the packages
whitout signing them. For the list with the parameters you can give, see
'man dpkg-buildpackage'.
