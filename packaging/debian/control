Description: OpenSER - very fast and configurable SIP proxy
 OpenSER is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3621)
 proxy server. Written entirely in C, OpenSER can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 C Shell-like scripting language provides full control over the server's
 behaviour. Its modular architecture allows only required functionality to be
 loaded.
 .
 Among others, the following modules are available: Digest Authentication, CPL
 scripts, Instant Messaging, MySQL support, Presence Agent, Radius
 Authentication, Record Routing, SMS Gateway, Jabber Gateway, Transaction
 Module, Registrar and User Location, ENUM, LCR, TLS secure communication.
 .
 This package contains the main OpenSER binary along with the principal modules
 and support binaries.
