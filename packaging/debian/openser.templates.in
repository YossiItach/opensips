Template: openser##PKGVER##/start_on_boot
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Should OpenSER start on boot?
 Select 'Yes' here if you want OpenSER to automatically start on boot.
 If you choose 'No', OpenSER will not start on boot and will have to be
 started manually by typing '/etc/init.d/openser start'. 

Template: openser##PKGVER##/memory_ammount
Type: string
Default: 32
Description: Amount of memory for the OpenSER server (in Mb)
 Please specify the ammount of memory (in Mb) that OpenSER will use.
 
 The default value is 32Mb, which may be too low if your server is servicing
 more than a dozen of users or experiences a high SIP traffic. Depending on 
 your number of SIP users and the traffic that the SIP proxy will be handling
 it is recommended to increase this ammount to a more appropriate value like
 256 or 512 Mb. If you are unsure what to select, choose a lower value like
 64 or 128, which can be increased later (if openser gives error messages
 about insufficient memory), by running 'dpkg-reconfigure openser'.

Template: openser##PKGVER##/memory_warning
Type: note
Description: Invalid ammount of memory!
 The ammount of memory should be a positive number representing the number of
 MegaBytes that OpenSER will have allocated at runtime.

Template: openser##PKGVER##/dump_core
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Should OpenSER dump a core when it crashes?
 Select 'Yes' here if you want OpenSER to leave a core file when it crahes.
 This can help if you want to obtain useful debugging information to trace
 the crash, after such a crash happens. The core file will be written in
 OpenSER's home directory in /var/run/openser.
 
 Important node!!!
 
 To be able to leave a core file, OpenSER needs to run as the root user.
 Thus if this feature is enabled, the USER and GROUP settings from
 /etc/default/openser will be ignored and root will be used instead.
 If this is a security concern to you, do not enable this function!
 
 The default is not to dump core files, which is a more appropriate choice
 if you are not interested in debugging OpenSER.
