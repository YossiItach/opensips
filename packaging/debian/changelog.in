openser##PKGVER## (1.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create a sequence file for use if the radius accounting is enabled,
    which is guaranteed to be writable by openser no matter what user
    and group is running as. If radius accounting is used, this can be
    added in your clients.conf that is used by openser as:
    seqfile /var/run/openser/openser_radius.seq

openser##PKGVER## (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for debconf. A number of things can now be configured
    when installing the package: if to start on boot, the ammount of
    memory the openser server will use and if to dump core files when
    the server crashes.
  * Added support for storing startup options in /etc/default/openser.
    This file is used by /etc/init.d/openser to setup various startup
    options which no longer need to be modified in the startup script
    itself.
  * Fixed issue with not adding dependency on libradius-ng
  * Fixed issue with the debian postinst scripts which resulted in the
    openser system user not being created for the openser-tls package
  * Fixed issue with some debhelper entries being added twice in the
    openser postrm and prerm scripts
  * Fixed issue with the openser system user not having his home
    directory removed on purge
  * Fixed a number of typos in the Suggests and Conflicts directives
    in the debian control file
  * Up to date with recent bugfixes from upstream
