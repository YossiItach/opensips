openser (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for debconf. A number of things can now be configured
    when installing the package: if to start on boot, the ammount of
    memory the openser server will use and if to dump core files when
    the server crashes.
  * Added support for storing startup options in /etc/default/openser.
    This file is used by /etc/init.d/openser to setup various startup
    options which no longer need to be modified in the startup script
    itself.
  * Fixed issue with not adding dependency on libradius-ng
  * Fixed issue with the debian postinst scripts which resulted in the
    openser system user not being created for the openser-tls package
  * Fixed issue with some debhelper entries being added twice in the
    openser postrm and prerm scripts
  * Fixed issue with the openser system user not having his home
    directory removed on purge
  * Fixed a number of typos in the Suggests and Conflicts directives
    in the debian control file
  * Up to date with recent bugfixes from upstream
