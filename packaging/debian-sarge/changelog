openser (1.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Debian release (closes: #380450).

  * Official Debian builds have no TLS support due to the lack of OpenSSL
    license exception for OpenSER. Building TLS packages is supported using
    the upstream TLS tarball with no modifications (you'll need libssl-dev).

  * debian/openser.init:
    + Do not start OpenSER in the start target if fork=no is specified in
      the config file, so as to not break the boot process.
  * debian/rules:
    + Detect TLS/non-TLS sources, and enable TLS build accordingly.
    + get-orig-source will fetch the non-TLS version for the official builds.
    + Emulate debhelper v5 behaviour for debug symbols when build with
      DH_COMPAT 4 to ease Sarge backports.
  * debian/control:
    + Drop build-dependency on libssl-dev for official Debian builds.
    + Simplify dependencies/conflicts.

openser (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Packaging sanitized.
  * Remove everything debconf-related; setting up an HA cluster is an
    advanced use of OpenSER which cannot be handled through debconf anyway.
  * debian/control:
    + Remove all -tls- packages.
    + Add missing build-depends: zlib1g-dev, flex, bison.
    + Build-Depend on libradiusclient-ng-dev, libmysqlclient15-dev.
    + Packages descriptions rewritten.
    + Add an openser-dbg package.
  * debian/rules:
    + Remove everything related to -tls- packages.
    + Build with -g -Wall -O2
  * debian/patches/01_ungetooize.dpatch:
    + Added; Do not override CFLAGS if set in the environment. Allows building
      at a rational optimisation level, and passing extra CFLAGS for debugging.
  * debian/patches/02_postgres_module_build.dpatch:
    + Added; Remove unneeded architecture restriction for the PostgreSQL module
      build.

openser (1.0.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create a sequence file for use if the radius accounting is enabled,
    which is guaranteed to be writable by openser no matter what user
    and group is running as. If radius accounting is used, this can be
    added in your clients.conf that is used by openser as:
    seqfile /var/run/openser/openser_radius.seq
  * Fixed wording in the master_node template description

openser (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for debconf. A number of things can now be configured
    when installing the package: if to start on boot, the ammount of
    memory the openser server will use and if to dump core files when
    the server crashes.
  * Added support for storing startup options in /etc/default/openser.
    This file is used by /etc/init.d/openser to setup various startup
    options which no longer need to be modified in the startup script
    itself.
  * Fixed issue with not adding dependency on libradius-ng
  * Fixed issue with the debian postinst scripts which resulted in the
    openser system user not being created for the openser-tls package
  * Fixed issue with some debhelper entries being added twice in the
    openser postrm and prerm scripts
  * Fixed issue with the openser system user not having his home
    directory removed on purge
  * Fixed a number of typos in the Suggests and Conflicts directives
    in the debian control file
  * Up to date with recent bugfixes from upstream
