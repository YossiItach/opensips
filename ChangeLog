	* [5910] :

	Rollback changes made in revision #5804

	The checks are unnecessary and they only hide the error by no longer sending
	keepalive messages to the affected endpoints. In reality contact->uri should 
	always be sip:IP:port so no extra checks are required. The port is always
	present even when default and the uri is built from the msg->rcv structure
	so it doesn't depend on any user setting from the script.

	In the end the segfault cause has proven to be in the sdp parser code that
	corrupted the shared memory.
