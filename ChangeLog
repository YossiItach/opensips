  ERROR 1071 (42000): Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes
Solution was to:
1) Test what's the character encoding is used in database.
2) If it's a UCS-2 or UTF8 (where 3 bytes per char are used) then warn
user that db couldn't be created and prompt him to select another
character encoding among available.
3) In a "CREATE DATABASE" use closure "CHARACTER SET"

* 2006-11-29 Dan Pascu <dan@ag-projects.com>
 - Fixed domain_reload and trusted_reload commands not working over the UNIX
socket interface.

Basically any command that needed a database connection was not working
over the UNIX socket interface as the process carrying the unix domain
socket server didn't have a database connection.

* 2006-11-29 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- bug fixed: improper free of linked list (first delete and later iterate)

 - local generated requests will include a Content-Length header all the time.
reported by Chris Robson <Chris.Robson@nrl.navy.mil>

* 2006-11-28 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- usage of AoR hash to index the records
- tests with hundreds of records per hashtable entry having same length of AoR proved that hash value is different which increase the probability that a integer comparison will match the AoR, avoiding string comparisons quite a lot
- devel version increased
- some extra debug messages to help in testing (to be removed later once proves stable)

* 2006-11-27 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>

-added new field for pseudo-variables in exported interface

* 2006-11-23 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- modules can register pseudo-variables via export structure
- a null terminated list with PVs is now part of module's exports
	{ pv-name, pv-function, pv-type, pv-parameter }
- the old function to register PV can be still used
- small tlsops updates: module name in exports aligned with external name
and old TLS pseudo-variables moved to new structure (some by Klaus Darilion)

* 2006-11-23 Klaus Darilion <klaus.mailinglists@pernau.at>
- fixed require_client_certificate for default TLS server domain
  (reported and patch contributed by Philippe phgs@free.fr

  default values are 0)

* 2006-11-23 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- fromip for outbound proxy-ed requests set to local ip (credits to Dan Pascu)

* 2006-11-22 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- fixed display problem in "openserctl monit"; "tput cup 0 0" replaced with "tput clear" - it is inevitable to do a clear since the printed lines may vary as length (get smaller); also a printed line may be wrapped over several terminal raws if the terminal size is changed on the fly.
Closes 1528402.

* 2006-11-22 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- applied patch from Marcos Hack for adding SQL_DECIMAL type. Closes 1598507.

   SQL_DATE, SQL_TIME, SQL_TIMESTAMP, SQL_TYPE_DATE, SQL_TYPE_TIME for data-time

* 2006-11-22 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- "use_domain" module parameter removed as now it is internally imported from the usrloc module
- save_memory() and save_noreply() merged into save(domain,flags) - more flexible in combination of functionalitites
- configuration error is generated if MEMORY ONLY flag is used on save() while the DB_ONLY mode is configured in usrloc.
- docs and faq updated

* 2006-11-22 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
 - local function mi_get_mask() replaced with the new core function strno2int()

* 2006-11-22 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
 - new functions strno2int() added - a warpper on top of int2str() and strhex2int() for easy conversion of strings in decimal and hexa format; binary format should be also added in future

* 2006-11-22 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- fromip for local generated messages is set to the address of the socket used to send
- toip for sip_trace() recorded messages is set the address of the socked where the message was received

* 2006-11-21 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
-fixed handeling of the permanent contacts (to work properly in DB_ONLY mode):
	- FL_PRESISTENT flag removed
	- persistent contacts are identified by having the expires=0
	- timer routine for deleting expire contacts in DB_ONLY does not need to deal with flags for skipping the permanent contacts (flag testing in quite impossible via the current DB API)
- removed unused flag from usrloc
- openserctl ul ops updated to reflect the changes for the persistent contacts
Closes 1579127.

* 2006-11-16 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
 - MI support added (existing FIFO functions migrated to MI)

* 2006-11-16 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- fixed bug in loading the radius values in the ACC module
  Closes 1596427 (reported by Philippe Sultan)
  Most probably it will be needed to do a RADIUS cleanup in all the radius related modules as the original idea of aloading the radius dictionary does not scale anymore.

* 2006-11-13 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
 Issue:
In CPL, during a proxy to a location set the
value of the branch flag being passed to append_branch
is currently the configured value for "nat_flag" (ie 6).
However, append_branch is expecting a bit mapped flag value (ie 0x40).
Also in CPL, the nat flag is getting set for the msg
if any branches have the nat flag set. This can cause
the RURI branch to have the nat flag set when the
location associated with the RURI branch does not
have the branch flag set.
Also, to be consistant with the default used in the
registrar module, made the default for nat flag -1
in the cpl-c module.
 Patch provided by John Riordan <john@junctionnetworks.com>


* 2006-11-13 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
 Issue:
In CPL, during a location lookup, the lookup fails
for users with an '_' in the user portion of the AOR.
For example, if the AOR is user_1@domain.com, cpl
registration lookup always fail.

 Patch:
Use tolower(c) instead of (0x20)|(c) when building
the interpreters copy of the AOR.
 Patch provided by John Riordan <john@junctionnetworks.com>


* 2006-11-08 Norman Brandinger <norm@goes.com>
 - Removed warning messages generated on 64-bit systems.   printf("%d",sizeof(x)) changed to printf("%lu",(unsigned long)sizeof(x)).  Tested ok on both 32 and 64 bit systems.

* 2006-11-02 Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com>
- Split enum_query function into pre-processing stuff and do_query
  function that does the actual query.
- Introduced infrastructure enum query function i_enum_query and
  associated module variables (contributed by Otmar Lendl).


* 2006-11-02 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- the ACK TM callback set in the "reply code" param the method ID - this leads to incompatibilities in the ACC module -> use the code directly from transaction
  Problem reported by Norman Brandinger <norm@goes.com

* 2006-11-01 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- fixed memory free - the private memory used by the fifo parser cannot be freed in module destroy since allocation is done in a different process
 Reported by Anca-Maria Vamanu <anca@voice-system.ro>

* 2006-11-01 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>

-DB name updated - reported by Doug Meredith <doug.meredith@systemguard.com>

* 2006-10-27 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- new pseudo-variable- $Au (accounting username) item that gets username the
  same way as accounting module was doing - try to get it first from credentials
  and if nor present, use the FROM URI.
  This PV will compensate (read : make life easier) the removel of USERNAME
  RADIUS AVP in ACC module

  Credits go to Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com>.

* 2006-10-27 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
 - ACC DB aligned to latest changes in ACC module - from_uri, to_uri and cseq columns were dropped.

* 2006-10-27 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- the minimal ACC set reduced even more (FROM and TO uri and cseq no) - see the thread on devel@openser.org for reasons.
- for RADIUS acc, the USERNAME RADIUS avp is not added by default - it will be replaced by a pseudo-variable, thanks to Juha

* 2006-10-26 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- support for read-only query in 'openserctl db'
- support to define queries in variables inside openserctlrc and then run it via variable name with 'openserctl db [ro]run varquery'
- example:
openserctlrc: LISTUSERS="select username,domain,email,rpid from subscriber"
> openserctl db rorun LISTUSERS

* 2006-10-26 Dan Pascu <dan@ag-projects.com>
- Added ability to specify the NAT IP address of the signaling via and AVP
  If this AVP is set, it should contain an IP address that will be used as
  the address of the NAT from where the SIP signaling originated, else src_ip
  will be used (previous behaviour). This is useful in cases where the SIP
  proxy that actually starts mediaproxy does not receive the signaling
  directly from the UA, but there are other proxies in the path in front of
  it. In such a case a way to propagate the NAT IP is required and than that
  IP should be set into the signaling_ip_avp for mediaproxy to use.


* 2006-10-24 Klaus Darilion <klaus.mailinglists@pernau.at>
- new module: domainpolicy
- adds domainpolicy lookup according to draft-lendl-domain-policy-ddds-02

- MI interface extended:
        - each MI function may register an init function to be called from the
          MI processes
        - module may register MI functions in a more simpler way, via module's
          export interface instead of using register_mi_cmd()

- all module migrated to the changes in the module_export

- some syncronizations fixes in the MI functions in imc module

- new module ported to the new MI - flatstore and pdt

-applied patch from Carsten Bock, BASIS AudioNet GmbH for removing the "desc_time_order" module parameter as its functionality was migrated to usrloc module.

* 2006-10-06 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- "desc_time_order" usrloc module parameter controls the contacts order per
  user both at insert and update time.
  If enabled, the first contacts in the list will be the latest modified
  (inserted or updated); otherwise the list will be kept order by the q
  value.
- "desc_time_order" has also affect if db_mod is DB_ONLY.

- as there is no way to constrain a callback function to change the
  pointer and len of the received parameter string, be sure to pass to the
  callback a copy in order to protect the internal values.
  For example, the "path" module does this, so all later call of
  check_route_param () will fail.

  Many thanks to Helge Waastad <helge@smartnet.no> for the help to
  debug this.

- New module for implementing FIFO transport layer for Management Interface.
In the near future it will replace te current FIFO implementation (core and modules).

* 2006-10-02 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
 - Statistic external functions are also exported via the new Management Interface.
 The new functions are more flexible since they accept as arguments a list of modules or statistic variables to be listed/reset

Ex: get_statistics usrloc: shmem: inuse_transactions
    # this lists all variables from usrloc and shmem modules and the
	# inuse_transactions variable

	reset_statistics rcv_requests rcv_replies
	# resets a list of statistic variables


* 2006-10-02 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
Management Interface (MI) - interface to provide common functions and data structure between the implementation and transport part for management functions (external triggers for OpenSER); Disregarding the transport/connection type (fifo, unixsocks, netsocks), the implementation will be the same using the data structures (for reading the commands and writing the replies) provided by the interface.
New specific OpenSER modules will implement the transport layer - they will read, parse and build the data structures according to interface specifications; the data is passed to the processing function (which are exported by whatever module or by core) - as reply the functions will return the response packed in some data type; this reply will be written according to the implemented transport layer.

MI interface and future module for transport layer implementation will replace the current FIFO and UNIXSOCK removing the core dependency to the transport layer.

Also the approach offers more flexibility from both modules and core point of view:
    1) core does not need to be changed each type a new transport is to be implemented; this will simple be a new module
    2) modules will not have to implement same exported functions depending of the transport layer (like one implementation for FIFO, one for unixsocks, etc) - will be only one implementation for MI and the function will be visible via all transport layers.

-grand ACC restructuring and clean-up:
    - simplify internal logic for preparing and message selection
    - more efficient data collection
    - eliminate the FMT-based accounting; instead of it, a default set of
      basic values are all the time accounted; for more, extra accounting
      should be used -> this leads to a more selective / flexible / performant
      accounting
    - pre-builds sets of names / columns / RADIUS AVPs / DIAMETER AVPs instead
      of doing it each time a request is accounted
    - "n/a" string for not found/available values replaced with empty string ""
    - eliminated a lot of un-necessary functions - heritage from the all TM
      callback design (pre pre-transaction transaction)
    - DB accounting table redesigned
    - accounting logic separated in a new file for a better modularity.
    - implemented an accounting environment for storing data; helps in reducing
      the number of function's parameters and of internal functions; more
      important, useless conversions from str to int and to int again are
      eliminated

* 2006-09-22 Klaus Darilion <klaus.mailinglists@pernau.at>

* 2006-09-19 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- New module uploaded: SIP Session Timer (sst)
  Provided by Ron Winacott <ronw@somanetworks.com>

  Description:
  The new module gives OpenSER basic SIP Session Timer support. See rfc4028 for
  more information on SST. This new module uses the new dialog module to track
  the creation, updating and termination of SIP dialogs. The dialog module
  supports timed out termination of the dialog but at this time the timeout
  value is hardcoded (avp accessable and modparam() settable)

  What the sst module does is uses the dialogs own callbacks to update the
  dialog timeout value based on the current expire: header value.

  There is also a script function called sstCheckMin(min_se_value) that can be
  used in a proxy configuration to reply with a 422 "Session Interval Too
  Small" to a INVITE with a small MIN_SE value.


* 2006-09-19 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>

  reduced redundant code
  reduce static used memory
  optimized the coletction mechanism for data to be accounted

- core: even if it has no script parameters, a function may export a fixup
  function. If, param  no. = 0, the fixup will be called with param index 0.
  If function has params, nothing is changed. The possibility to have a fixup
  function even if no param is exported is useful when checking global settings
  that may affect the behaviour of the function.
- uri_db: "db_url" module parameter may be set to empty string in orer to
  disable DB support in the module - this is needed if you want to use
  check_to() or check_from() to check the user against credentials in a non DB
  environment.
- tm: fixed branch picking algorithm - if cancelled, but not 487 replied
  received, fallback and use classical algorithm.
- tm: fixed bug in CANCEL retransmission - an implementation more closer to the
  hop by hop CANCEL processing concept
- core: - fixed bug in parsing display name in format:
  "From: token1 token2<uri>"

- avpops: memory leak fixed in avp_raw_query()
  Credits go to John Riordan <john@junctionnetworks.com>
- core: FROM / TO header paramter parsing fixed:
    1) TAG parameter must have value, but any other parameters are accepted
        without value
    2) removed the NO_PINGTEL_TAG_HACK (long time ago, pingtel phones were
        sending empty tag param in TO) - it's conflicting the RFC 3261;
  Reported by Ovidiu Sas <osas@somanetworks.com>.
- permissions: fixed crash when permission module was shutdown after an
  incomplete startup. Reported by  Elton Machado (lowgitek).
- tm: bug fixed in building ACKs for negative replies to local INVITEs. RURI
  must be the same as in INVITE and Route hdr have no send to be added.
  Thanks to Elias Baixas <elias.baixas@voztele.com> for troubleshooting the
  problem.

* 2006-05-22 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- core: forward and send functions merged by including the protocol, host and
  port into a single parameter like [proto:]host[:port]. Aligned to t_relay()
  and t_forward() format and NAPTR lookup enabled also.
- core: applied patch from Klaus Darilion :  provides TLS client domains
  (name/socket based) and more script config capabilities
- tlsops: new module for TLS operations, patch by Klaus Darilion

* 2006-05-22 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- acc: null pseudo-variable values are stoared as "n/a" to keep consistency
  with acc format (reported by Juha Heinanen)

* 2006-05-19 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- avpops: branch can be used as new destinaton for avp_pushto().
    Ex: avp_pushto("$br","$avp(i:30)");  - it will push the avp directly as a
        new branch without affecting the RURI.
- acc: bugs fixed:
  ~ the "missed call" report will display as outgoing uri exactly the RURI used
    for that branch
  ~ the accounting report will display as outgoing uri the RURI of the winning
    branch
  ~ proper internally handling (set/reset) of the "missed call" flag
- acc: behaviour fix:
  ~ the "missed call" flag has effect only on the next serial fork - once
    triggered to report a missed call (a serial fork step ended), the flag is
    automatically reset by module. To catch the potential "missed call" reports
    due next serial forks, you need to re-arm the flag from failure route.
    This behaviour gives full control over what branches should be or not
    accounted as "missed calls".
- tm: branch selection algorithm centralized in a single place - more coherent
    and easier to maintain.
  ~ the selected branch in stored in a static variable to avoid multiple
    computation for same transaction (so far, each t_check_status() call was
    triggering computation of the selected branch)
  ~ TM API exports a new function for making public the selected branch (how
    the winning branch is selected must be transparent for the other modules)
  ~ fixed the branch selection algorithm - if the transaction was cancelled, the
    "487 Request cancelled" reply will have priority and it will be sent to UAC.
- usrloc: module is able to detect retransmissions based on Callid and Cseq. The
  retransmission detecton is controled via the new "cseq_delay" module
  parameter.
  REGISTER retransmissions (inside the cseq_delay interval) will not generate
  error, but they will be accepted and properly replied without any update on
  the location status.
  This solves the problem of retransmissions without having a statefull
  processing on requests.
- core:  new function added : int branch_uri2dset( str *new_uri ) ->
  moves the uri to destination for all branches and all uris are set to
  given uri; to be used to implement replication to multiple destinations
- tm: t_replicate() takes as parameter a SIP URI instead of a destination (in
  order to align the format as for append_branch() ).
- tm: t_replicate() uses the set branches to perform parallel replication to
  multiple destinations

- rr: bug fixed in routing after a strict router
  Reported by Walter Schober <walter.schober@neotel.at>

* 2006-05-07 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- core: added support to manage AVP flags from configuration script
  ~ flags are 8bit long and have to specified after the AVP name type and before the semicolon, e.g., s3:rpid - string-named AVP with flags 1 and 2 set
  ~ avp naming is now $avp(name_type[flags]:name_id) - name_type = s | i;
    script_flags = 1..255
  ~ a reference to an AVP via alias is now: $avp(alias)
  ~ updated AVP API to allow flags usage

* 2006-05-05 Dan Pascu <dan@ag-projects.com>
- auth_db: Properly handle integer columns in the subscriber table when
  generating the AVPs specified by the auth_db/load_credentials module
  parameter. This fixes crahses caused by invalid memory access when a
  non-string column was specified to be loaded in load_credentials.
   With this patch, string and integer table columns are properly handled and
  will create an AVP with a string respectively an integer value depending
  on the type of the column in the subscriber table that is loaded.
  Other column types are currently not handled and will generate an error
  message in the logs if used, however if need arises they can be handled by
  converting them to a string and creating an AVP with a string value.
- core: Added missing definition for pkg_realloc if PKG_MALLOC was not defined
  and the standard libc allocation functions were used

- tm: applied patch provided by Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com> : port from
  SER of "pass_provisional_replies" TM options (pass back through unixsock
  the provisional replies and not only the final one).
  This was required in order to maintain compatbility with latest SEMS
  version.
- nathelper: added support for changing session-level SDP connection (c=) IP
  when media-description also includes connection information.
  This can be enabled by setting the "c" flag to force_rtp_proxy()
  Based on a patch sent by Bayan Towfiq <bayan@towfiq.com>

* 2006-03-24 Dan Pascu <dan@ag-projects.com>
- mediaproxy: do not print error to syslog is SDP body is missing. Return a
  different negative code instead (-2) and let the caller handle the error
  (there are cases where a missing SDP body is not an error and can be ignored).
  This also helps by avoiding the need to call a has_body() function prior
  to calling use_media_proxy(). Instead call use_media_proxy() directly and
  it will tell you if it can't find a body, but without giving an error to
  syslog

* 2006-03-20 Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com>

* 2006-03-13 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- osp: module aligned to use the RR functionality via the RR API to avoid
  mismatches between function prototypes.
- core: more hash functionality:
  1) hash support in core
      - new_hash1() and new_hash2() merged into core_hash()
      - added core_case_hash() for case insensitive hashes
      - all TM related definitions moved into TM config file
      - if hash size param is 0, the functions will return the hash id
        instead of hash entry.
  2) domain module
      - use the case insensitive hash function
  3) pdt module
      - use the case insensitive hash function
  4) permission module
      - just updated according to coe hash changes
  5) TM module
      - updated according to coe hash changes
      - TM related stuff moved localy from core hash
- registrar: fixed memory bug - build_path_vector() does not allocated memory
  for the path array (returns a static buffer), so no free is needed anymore.
  Reported by Helge Waastad <helge@smartnet.no>
- registrar: build_path_vector() use the sibling link between the headers in
  order to have a faster access to all PATH headers.

  cases were not properly handled.
  Reported by Matt Schulte <mschulte@netlogic.net>

* 2006-03-08 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- nathelper: several upgrades to existing functions:
   - fix_nated_sdp() may take one more param to force a specific IP instead of
        the signalling IP
   - force_rtp_proxy() accepts a new flag 's' to swap creation/confirmation
        between requests/replies (this is needed to be able to cope with SDPs
        advertised via 200OK / ACK)
   - add_rcv_param() may take as parameter a flag telling if the parameter
     should go to the contact URI or contact header; make sense if you forward
     REGISTER requests and need the registrar to save the parameter as part of
     URI.
- usrloc: bug fixed when getting all contacts - most probably the bug was
  inserted when the DB_ONLY mode was added

* 2006-03-07 Dmitry Isakbayev <isakdim@gmail.com>
 - osp: update module for:
  1. int_str casing issue, in destination.c and usage.c

* 2006-03-07 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- acc: etc/dictionary.radius contains only the OpenSER proprietary attributes
  and values; All standard (IANA registered) attributes are defined in the
  default dictionary of the radiusclient-ng library
- acc: values for Sip-Method attribute set as they are used by OpenSER. NOTE
  they overwrite the default values as defined by radiusclient-ng library.

* 2006-03-03 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- osp: removed dependency of textops module - append_hf() replaced with a local
  function

* 2006-03-03 Andreas Granig <andreas.granig@inode.info>
- path: new module for intermediate proxies to add Path-HFs and route
  requests according to the received-parameter of Route-HF URIs.

* 2006-03-03 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- registrar: support in registrar for loadbalancing using Path-HF with
  NAT-Support applied, patch by Andreas Granig <andreas.granig@inode.info>
- uac: default value for "from_restore_mode" switch to auto
- uac: new module parameter "from_passwd" - used to encrypt the RR parameter
  which contains the original FROM URI
- uac: uac_replace_from() adds the display name if not present (so far it only
  replaced it); uri is enclosed between brackets if not.
  Actually, now you can set a display name if none was present.

* 2006-03-02 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- $si and $sp were mistakenly changed in $Si and $Sp by previous commit
  - reverted now (reported by Thomas Gelf)

* 2006-03-02 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- uac: when performing UAC authentication, look in predefined AVPs for
  credentials before using the static set credentials (via modparam)
- uac: new module parameters for defining the AVPs to contain realm, username
  and password for authentication.
- core: new header chaining based on type - all headers of same type are linked
  together via sibling link (Ex: msg->allow points to first Allow hdr;
  msg->allow->sibling to the second Allow hdr, and so on).
- core: parser for Allow ans Supported headers updated to parse and merge the
  values from all headers. This fixes problems in REGISTER module when PATH or
  method filtering supports are used - originally only the first
  allow/supported hdr was processed, the rest of them being ignore. This was
  problem maker if a client was registering with multiple Allow hdr, for
  example - reported by Daniel Hsueh <dhsueh@somanetworks.com>.
- core: several changes into routing/scripting internal tree:
  1) allow module to export same C function with same name, but with different
     parameter number - a lot of wrapper functions will become obsolete
  
  2) keep inside the tree nodes the corresponding config line to be able to
     give a more detailed report if fixup functions fails (like line number)
  
  3) some cleanup to simplify the association between the tree actions and
     exported functions

* 2006-03-01 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- core: XL_RPID, XL_DIVERSION types renamed to XL_RPID_URI, XL_DIVERSION_URI
- core: allow long names for pseudo-variables in format $(name)
- core: possibility to register pseudo-variables from modules
- tm:  module exports $T_branch_idx pseudo-variable refering to the index of
  the branch for which the branch_route[] is executed
- core: avp names must use i: or s: in front of IDs to avoid confusions
- core: avp alias is specified without $

* 2006-03-01 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- acc: Radius acc requests include an event time stamp (Event-Timestamp Radius
  AVP - see RFC2869). The Radius server timpstamp is not reliable since it
  contains also the delays due possible RADIUS retransmissions.
- unixodbc: several problems fixed:
  1) memory allocation size problem when converting the returned rows.
  2) use a define for the size of the static strings - avoid mem. overrides
     if changing the size
  3) more general connection cleanup (properly supported by a larger number
     of drivers)  before submitting a new query
- core: returne codes alligned (for widly used core functions) in order to
  avoid confusions
          == 0 - success
           < 0 - error
- cpl-c: applied patch from John Riordan <john@junctionnetworks.com> : provides
  NAT traversal support (via received) for the lookup CPL node.
- cpl-c: added per branch nat flags support for lookup CPL node
- auth: realm string in www/proxy challenge/authorize support pseudo variables.
  Allows dynamic realm definition in multi domain env.

- core: fixed parsing bug when spaces are present in non-quoted display name.
  reported by Raymond Chen <rchen@broadz.com>
- usrloc: fixed bug when insertion contacts in a new built AOR record - use
    get_ucontact() to detect contact duplicates.
    An initial REGISTER may contain several contacts and some of them may be
    identical. IF DB is used, this will lead to primary key (username, domain,
    contact URI) violation due double insert. Also un-necessary parallel fork
    to same destination is avoided.
  
    This may happen with bogus clients (I see no reason why a UAC may duplicate
    a contact in same REGISTER), so the fix is protection mechanism for the
    proxy.

* 2006-02-23 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- usrloc: new DB mode - DB-Only - no memory cache is kept, all operation being
    directly done into DB.
    Allows DB sharing between multiple proxies without the need of additional
    replication mechanism.
    Drawbacks:
          - some performance penalties due intensive DB usage
          - location watcher disabled (cannot be bind to a record into mem)
                          => PA cannot be used
          - statistics do not work since events cannot be properly been traced
            without a mem cache

* 2006-02-22 Klaus Darilion <klaus.mailinglists@pernau.at>

          - replace_body()
          - replace_body_all()
          - subst_body()

* 2006-02-17 Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com>

  Empty from_pattern matches any From URI.

* 2006-02-17 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- core: applied patch from Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com> : new pseudo-variables

* 2006-02-16 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- core: fixed several bugs strictly related to libssl version 0.9.8:
  1) bad record mac because of wrong SSL_OP_TLS_BLOCK_PADDING_BUG handling
     (see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=338006 for more
     info ; original bug registration to libssl at
     http://www.aet.tu-cottbus.de/rt2/Ticket/Display.html?id=1204 - note, it
     requires subscription)
  2) zlib compression does work correctly anymore in multi-process env. due
     problem with mem. allocation functions. Fix: disable compression.
     (see http://www.aet.tu-cottbus.de/rt2/NoAuth/Buglist.html - again,
     subscription is required)
- core: bug fixed : return code of tcp_send() set to negative value if write()
    failed; this was preventing the proxy to generate a negative reply in case
    of connection error via TCP (TLS was affected too).
    Reported by Klaus Darilion <klaus.mailinglists@pernau.at>

* 2006-02-15 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- core: function to get avp name from pseudo-variable specifier

* 2005-09-11 Klaus Darilion <klaus.mailinglists@pernau.at>
- postgres: adding transaction rollback for failed queries (postgres module
  encapsulates every query into transaction. If the query failed, the
  transcation was not finished, thus a new database connection was created
  on the next query)

* 2005-09-09 Elena-Ramona Modroiu <ramona@voice-system.ro>
- avpops: avp_write() allow $hdr(name) to be coherent with avp_printf()

  where it checks host part of first branch (which thus must have been earlier
  appended to the transaction)

* 2005-09-05 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- acc: DB support is compiled by default
- acc: DB support disabled by default (db_url=0)

  it's equivalent to "exit"):
    - BRANCH ROUTE - the request branch is discarded (not fwd);
    - ONREPLY ROUTE - if provisional reply (<200), it will be discarded (not
      fwd, not stored, but only timers updated)

* 2005-08-29 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- core: new internal core function for checking if a module function may or

    - isdsturiset() - test if there is a dst_uri address set
- avpops: avp_write() and avp_pushto() can access and set dst_uri field (if
  set, this is the next hop, regardless of r-uri address) via '$duri'

  request. By this, FROM mangling may be used in full automatic mode - all
  sequential replies and requests (in all directions) will be automatically
  fixed.
