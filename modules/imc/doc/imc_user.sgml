		This module offers support for instant message conference. It
		follows the architecture of IRC channels, you can send commands
		embedded in MESSAGE body, because there are no SIP UA clients
		which have GUI for IM conferencing.
	</para>
	<para>
	You have to define an URI corresponding to im conferencing manager, where
	user can send commands to create a new conference room. Once the conference
	room is created, users can send commands directly to conferece's URI.
	</para>
	<para>
	To ease the integration in the configuration file, the interpreter of
	the IMC commands are embeded in the module, from configuration poin of
	view, there is only one function which has to be executed for both
	messages and commands.
