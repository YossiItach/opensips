Usage: " NAME " -l address [-l address ...] [options]\n\
Options:\n\
    -f file      Configuration file (default " CFG_FILE ")\n\
    -c           Check configuration file for errors\n\
    -C           Similar to '-c' but in addition checks the flags of exported\n\
                  functions from included route blocks\n\
    -l address   Listen on the specified address/interface (multiple -l\n\
                  mean listening on more addresses).  The address format is\n\
                  [proto:]addr[:port], where proto=udp|tcp and \n\
                  addr= host|ip_address|interface_name. E.g: -l locahost, \n\
                  -l udp:127.0.0.1:5080, -l eth0:5062 The default behavior\n\
                  is to listen on all the interfaces.\n\
    -n processes Number of child processes to fork per interface\n\
                  (default: 8)\n\
    -r           Use dns to check if is necessary to add a \"received=\"\n\
                  field to a via\n\
    -R           Same as `-r` but use reverse dns;\n\
                  (to use both use `-rR`)\n\
    -v           Turn on \"via:\" host checking when forwarding replies\n\
    -d           Debugging mode (multiple -d increase the level)\n\
    -D           Do not fork into daemon mode\n\
    -E           Log to stderr\n"
#ifdef USE_TCP
"    -T           Disable tcp\n\
    -N processes Number of tcp child processes (default: equal to `-n`)\n\
    -W method    poll method\n"
#endif
"    -V           Version number\n\
    -h           This help message\n\
    -b nr        Maximum receive buffer size which will not be exceeded by\n\
                  auto-probing procedure even if  OS allows\n\
    -m nr        Size of shared memory allocated in Megabytes\n\
    -w dir       Change the working directory to \"dir\" (default \"/\")\n\
    -t dir       Chroot to \"dir\"\n\
    -u uid       Change uid \n\
    -g gid       Change gid \n\
    -P file      Create a pid file\n\
    -G file      Create a pgid file\n"
